ASPBERRY PI- you need to make a small change to how the dongle is recognised. Create and edit the file:

/etc/udev/rules.d/garmin-ant2.rules

and add the following line:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fcf", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1009", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0fcf product=0x1009"

(replace both 1009 entries with 1008 is lsusb shows your product id number as that)

REBOOT

Tested and working with raspberry pi 3 and latest raspbian
